This directory contains the sources of the PET system, consisting of two
major parts.

1) The `flop' preprocessor, that compiles a given grammar in text
   form into binary form usable by the runtime system.
2) The `cheap' parser framework. Parsers with different combinations of
   unifier, parsing strategy etc. can be built.

Layout of the sources:

common/ contains the sources shared between `flop' and `cheap'.

flop/ contains the sources for the preprocessor.

cheap/ contains the sources for the parser.

goofy/ contains the beginnings of a graphical interface, is not really useable
       except for viewing feature structures, and requires the QT library.
