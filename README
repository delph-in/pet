This directory contains the open source PET system.
PET consists of two major parts:

1) The `flop' preprocessor. It compiles a given grammar in text
   form into binary form usable by the runtime system.

2) The `cheap' parser. It parses input with respect to a grammar in the binary
   form produced by `flop'.

Layout of the sources:

common/ contains the sources shared between `flop' and `cheap'.

flop/ contains the sources for the preprocessor.

cheap/ contains the sources for the parser.

goofy/ contains the sources for an outdated GUI prototype. This hasn't been
compiled for two years and probably won't work.
