This directory contains the open source PET system. For license details 
please refer to the LICENSE file.

Overview
========

PET consists of two major parts:

1) The `flop' preprocessor. It compiles a given grammar in TDL
   format into a binary form usable by the runtime system.

2) The `cheap' parser. It parses input with respect to a grammar in the
   binary form produced by `flop'.

Grammars
========

Two freely available open source grammars that are compatible with PET
are the ERG (English, available from http://lingo.stanford.edu/ftp/erg.tgz,
or http://lingo.stanford.edu) and JACY (Japanese,
http://www.dfki.de/~siegel/grammar-download/JACY-grammar.html).

If you want to contribute a grammar, or if you are looking for more
grammars please have a look at www.delph-in.net

Running it
==========

Binaries for Linux are provided. To run the binaries you need the
(external) ICU and itsdb libraries (see below for details).

Compiling it
============

If you want to compile yourself, you additionally need the LEDA
library (for flop). The build system used for PET is Jam from perforce
(which is also included in Boost). gcc version 2.95.3. is the only
tested compiler for flop, for cheap gcc 2.95.3 and gcc 3.2.2 both work
fine. cheap has also been compiled using Borland C++ under Windows and
KCC for Linux and Solaris, so porting it to a new compiler should not
be too hard.

For unit tests and source code documentation you can optionally use
cppunit and doxygen. Note that so far only small parts of the system
take advantage of this.

A version of the preprocessor which does not depend on LEDA (but uses the
free Boost library instead) will be available shortly.

External Components
===================

ICU:

itsdb:
http://www.coli.uni-sb.de/itsdb, also included in recent LKB
distributions (http://www-csli.stanford.edu/~aac/lkb.html)

Jam:

Also included in Boost (www.boost.org)

cppunit:

doxygen:

Layout of the sources
=====================

common/ contains the sources shared between `flop' and `cheap'.

flop/ contains the sources for the preprocessor.

cheap/ contains the sources for the parser.

goofy/ contains the sources for an outdated GUI prototype. This hasn't been
compiled for two years and probably won't work.
