v0.99.13
  - oe integrated a change for the tsdb to escape the yield strings correctly
  - fixed bug 'assertion: is_type() failed' which occured with packing and
    dynamic symbols
  - updated option description to contain the -tok=fsr option
  - some reformatting
  - added "EOM" so that Uli can properly handle MRS and partial output in HoG
  - fixed syntax error in lingo-tokenizer.h which was detected by gcc 4.1.0

v0.99.12
  - remove borland directory from configure/make process
  - updated TODO list according to Jeres meeting
  - integration of x-preprocessor code: code split for ecl/mrs/preprocessor
    and change of library build, command line option -tok=fsr now activates
    preprocessor code (if compiled in)
  - changed mrs.system such that it puts the libmrs.a and mrs.h into the 
    cheap subdirectory
  - make item trait filtering work correctly (with oe in Jerez), which means
    that main is now doing as well as the oe branch
  - some code reformatting and code doc adaptation
  - chart item copy and assignment constructor inhibition went into a macro
  - fixed ecl_decode_string, which in some conditions returned improperly
    terminated C strings
  - generalized the find_file ugliness in cppbridge.cpp, sm.cpp and 
    settings.cpp and added some nice pathname functionality in utility.cpp

v0.99.11
  - fixed error with incomplete characterization (hopefully)
  - removed warnings on 64 bit machines in dag-tomabechi.h (only for gcc 3.4.4)

v0.99.10
  - renamed config.h(.in) to pet-config.h(.in) (avoid ecl like problems)
  - removed problematic sub-shell executions of AC_CHECK_HEADERS
  - added position-mapper.h to cheap_SOURCES in cheap/Makefile.am

v0.99.9
  - work on lexical psql database continued (unfinished)
  - changed characterization to make it work with unfilling
  - fixed performance problem in boost version of flop
  - moved propagate_status from flop.cpp to hierarchy.cpp where it logically 
    belongs 
  - fixed wrong dumping of inflection rules in some situations with many
    leaf types
  - added morph.cpp patches provided by oe (oe@csli.stanford.edu) for escaping
    certain characters in morph rules and applying irregular entries on every
    level of analysis
  - added some more comments
  - added some virtural destructors gcc4.0 complains about
  - added fs modifications for stem and form for Berthold
  - fixed wrong chart position mapping. Now put into its own class and file 
    position-mapper.h again
  - corrected behaviour of dependency filter in case lex_exhaustive is used
  - added printing of feature structures for fegramed

v0.99.8
  - patches provided by Eric Nichols <eric-n@is.naist.jp> (thanks a lot)
    , fixing the following problems:
    * flop bug on 2.6 kernels due to mmap problem
    * correct creation of mrs.h file in the autoconf/make scripts (no longer
      distributed by LKB)
    * fix problems with kernel/architecture specific subdirectories in LKB
  - patch provided by Francis Bond (thanks) concerning tsdb MWE's output 
    included
  - in all chart items that replay infl rules, it is attempted to unify either
    the base or the surface form into "orth-path"."path-to-inflpos". The base
    form is taken for all but the last of these, the surface form for the one
    that satisfies the last infl rule
  - added function dag_collect_symbols to dag_tomabechi.cpp to collect a type
    symbol table for a given dag
  - only tLexItems copy the _inflrs_todo list (saves a bit space)
  - fixed filtering of duplicate morphology analyses
  - moved code to collect readings from the chart into its own function
  - cleaned up handling of global variables in chunk allocator

v0.99.7
  - merge in oe branch: pass_through_comments, LUI dumping, orthographemic-...
  - minor code cleanup
  - bug fix in derivation printer concerning multi word entries

v0.99.6
  - small fix in common/hashing.h and configure.ac to be able to configure
    properly with cygwin
  - optional application of the rule filter during morphological analysis
    and fixed code to restrict the number of spelling rule applications
  - bug fix: blanks were not stripped correctly on the right side of
    orthographemic rules 
  - bug fix in code assigning input items chart positions derived from external
    positions

v0.99.5
  - dump chart in jxchg format even if an error occured, e.g., exhaustion of 
    passive edges (only if enabled)
  - deleted inactive code in grammar.cpp (punctuationp, translate_iso_chars)
  - fixed wrong is_stem_token predicate in item.h
  - fixed wrong string decoding in XML mode
  - XML tokenizing works from stream as well as from file, DTD is now optional
  - flop returns different exit codes depending on the error

v0.99.4
  - bugfixes and additions for XML input mode: missing infl tag, translate_iso,
    state names are static members of the state classes, state factory now
    creates new states, exception are correctly thrown and catched and are 
    decorated with the error location ; read XML from stdin directly rather
    than from file.
  - the isomorphix translation has been put completely into the tokenizers
  - temporarily removed the error "Duplicate failure path"; it is triggered
    when the german grammar with new restrictors is used to compute unification
    quickcheck paths (during computation of the rule filter)
  - chart::shortest_path is now a template function that gets an additional
    weight function object as argument

v0.99.3
  - restrictor can specify paths mixed with features (which are paths of length
    one anyway)

v0.99.2
  - build process with automake && autoconfig && configure for flop and cheap,
    boost and dumpgram binaries may be revived if used by anybody
  - adaptation of source files to use automatically build config.h
  - make the use of ICU really optional, i.e. make cheap work without ICU 
    altogether. 
  - corpus approximation (jxchg) output format provided anew
  - separate switches for unification and subsumption quickcheck computation
  - changed version mechanism to be supported by the auto... tools

v0.99.1
  - make XML input mode really optional, fixes in Makefile and cheap.cpp

v0.99.0
  Since this is the first entry, change descriptions are quite coarse
  grained. This should maybe change in the future.

  - Added doxygen compatible comments to most of the .h files, and some
    comments to source files too.
  - New input/lexical processing stage to allow more modularization and
    flexible exchange of tokenization, morphology, etc.
  - "japanese multiword bug" fixed
  - Application of inflection and lexical rules can now be completed before any
    syntactical processing takes place (which might be beneficial for 
    chart dependencies in german)
  - fixed bug in acyclic transitive reduction in the boost version of flop
  - expansion failures (flop) now report the failure path

  - XML input mode (also as an replacement for the whiteboard version)
  - first version of fragmentary results in case of parse failure, maybe needs
    more flexibility for better heuristics.
  - activation of packing without restrictor setting does no longer lead to a
    segmentation fault; packing is simply not activated.
  - translation of iso chars to isomorphix in YY input mode
  - [incr tsdb()] file dump mode
  - version string now included in flop and cheap binaries. version number is
    printed with usage information
  - printer for hierarchies in VCG tool style, can be used in cheap and flop
  - support for dynamic symbols
  - dag_expand now does the job correctly using a scheme similar to delta
    expansion.
  - moved the whole agenda code into the .h file with the hope of some positive
    inlining effects (and, besides, to get rid of another file).
  - more flexible restrictor functionality

  - lots of minor cleanup issues
  - first attempt to CHANGELOG, TODO, BUGS, version.h
