v0.99.6
  - small fix in common/hashing.h and configure.ac to be able to configure
    properly with cygwin
  - optional application of the rule filter during morphological analysis
    and fixed code to restrict the number of spelling rule applications
  - bug fix: blanks were not stripped correctly on the right side of
    orthographemic rules 
  - bug fix in code assigning input items chart positions derived from external
    positions

v0.99.5
  - dump chart in jxchg format even if an error occured, e.g., exhaustion of 
    passive edges (only if enabled)
  - deleted inactive code in grammar.cpp (punctuationp, translate_iso_chars)
  - fixed wrong is_stem_token predicate in item.h
  - fixed wrong string decoding in XML mode
  - XML tokenizing works from stream as well as from file, DTD is now optional
  - flop returns different exit codes depending on the error

v0.99.4
  - bugfixes and additions for XML input mode: missing infl tag, translate_iso,
    state names are static members of the state classes, state factory now
    creates new states, exception are correctly thrown and catched and are 
    decorated with the error location ; read XML from stdin directly rather
    than from file.
  - the isomorphix translation has been put completely into the tokenizers
  - temporarily removed the error "Duplicate failure path"; it is triggered
    when the german grammar with new restrictors is used to compute unification
    quickcheck paths (during computation of the rule filter)
  - chart::shortest_path is now a template function that gets an additional
    weight function object as argument

v0.99.3
  - restrictor can specify paths mixed with features (which are paths of length
    one anyway)

v0.99.2
  - build process with automake && autoconfig && configure for flop and cheap,
    boost and dumpgram binaries may be revived if used by anybody
  - adaptation of source files to use automatically build config.h
  - make the use of ICU really optional, i.e. make cheap work without ICU 
    altogether. 
  - corpus approximation (jxchg) output format provided anew
  - separate switches for unification and subsumption quickcheck computation
  - changed version mechanism to be supported by the auto... tools

v0.99.1
  - make XML input mode really optional, fixes in Makefile and cheap.cpp

v0.99.0
  Since this is the first entry, change descriptions are quite coarse
  grained. This should maybe change in the future.

  - Added doxygen compatible comments to most of the .h files, and some
    comments to source files too.
  - New input/lexical processing stage to allow more modularization and
    flexible exchange of tokenization, morphology, etc.
  - "japanese multiword bug" fixed
  - Application of inflection and lexical rules can now be completed before any
    syntactical processing takes place (which might be beneficial for 
    chart dependencies in german)
  - fixed bug in acyclic transitive reduction in the boost version of flop
  - expansion failures (flop) now report the failure path

  - XML input mode (also as an replacement for the whiteboard version)
  - first version of fragmentary results in case of parse failure, maybe needs
    more flexibility for better heuristics.
  - activation of packing without restrictor setting does no longer lead to a
    segmentation fault; packing is simply not activated.
  - translation of iso chars to isomorphix in YY input mode
  - [incr tsdb()] file dump mode
  - version string now included in flop and cheap binaries. version number is
    printed with usage information
  - printer for hierarchies in VCG tool style, can be used in cheap and flop
  - support for dynamic symbols
  - dag_expand now does the job correctly using a scheme similar to delta
    expansion.
  - moved the whole agenda code into the .h file with the hope of some positive
    inlining effects (and, besides, to get rid of another file).
  - more flexible restrictor functionality

  - lots of minor cleanup issues
  - first attempt to CHANGELOG, TODO, BUGS, version.h 

Done previously (from old ToDo file, partially redundant)

+ XML input mode
  + complete DTD specification (Uli S. and bk did this)
  + build SAX parser
  + supersedes integration of bernd's (whiteboard) version

+ fragmentary results in case of parse failure (v1.0)
  Fragmentsuche/-ausgabe im Falle von Parse-failures

+ integrate ecls LISP (seems to work now)
  + unfilling in PET leads to wrong / incomplete results (German grammar)
    re-expansion (dag_expand) gefixt
  + packing/unpacking does characterization too

+ leda -> boost migration done and checked

+ CFROM/CTO fix: toplevel errors

+ bei packing ohne packing-restrictor: segfault, jetzt: Warning & disable

+ Nullfehler bei MRS muss Ausgabe produzieren
+ YY-mode macht kein translate-iso-chars

+ Schreiben von TSDB-Tabellen aus PET
  + Erzeugen von item, parse und result tabellen, wenn PET in der HOG laeuft.
    yy.cpp ausschlachten: TSDBFILEAPI !!
  + Optionsbeschreibung einbauen
+ Counts fuer lexikalische Ambiguitaet

+ correct sorting of results according to score
+ -results=n option to get only the best n results
+ fullform-morphology gibt beim Drucken den Stem mit raus
+ Restricting the number of inflection rule applications

+ positions and counts for YY and XML tokenizer

+ japanese multiword bug (requires input chart redesign)
+? implement mrs/rmrs code - processor interface ?Is this implemented or not?

+ yy_tokenizer removed from yy.cpp
+ runtime selection of online-morphology vs full-forms
