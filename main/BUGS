- the bound on the number of inflection rules (setting max-inflections) does 
  not work
- flop is not able to dump cyclic structures

- wrong/no characterization when unfilling is used
  :-( No clean way to implement this; in fact, characterization should be 
  implemented in the grammar, not in the processing engine.

- "Duplicate failure path" is triggered when the german grammar with
  new restrictors is used to compute unification quickcheck paths
  (during computation of the rule filter)
