This directory contains the `flop' preprocessor. It compiles a given grammar
in TDL (text) form into a binary form suitable for efficient run time
processing. 

This used to be a C program, somewhat half-heartedly converted to C++. Some
stuff (like parse-tdl and expand) is barely commented, and probably hard to
understand for anyone not familiar with TDL and Carpenter (1992) etc.
Other things like the hierarchy module is well commented, but also 
requires a good understanding of the underlying concepts.
