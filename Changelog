  - Integrated input_chart and input_token from Bernd Kiefer

  - Complete redesign of lexicon/lex_items etc.

  - Changed fileformat to allow for easier extensions, and particularly 
  to store information required for on line morphology

  - Grammar rules and stems are no longer identified in the preprocessor;
  this is now done in the runtime system using status values

  - Abolished notion of symbols and instances. Everything is a type now;
  there are two kinds of types: proper types and leaf types. For leaf
  types only information about the parent type is stored, not a full
  bitcode.  This makes a number of tests that were spread all over the
  code unnecessary, and prepares the code for an open class of types.

  The unified treatment of TDL instances and TDL types requires a slight
  change in the way references to instances are made. Note that TDL
  instances and TDL types are in two seperate namespaces, i.e. there can
  be a TDL instance and a TDL type with the same name in one grammar.
  Previously, context was used to disambiguate TDL instance and TDL type
  names in configuration files, i.e. one setting either required all
  instances or all types. In the new unified setup, type and instance
  names can be used everywhere, but the names of TDL instances have to
  be prefixed with a '$'. For the moment, an exception is made for the
  full-form table.

  - Extended notion of leaf types: A leaf type is now a type that has
  exactly one parent, and only leaftypes as children (this subsumes the
  previous definition of leaftypes). This way, leaftypes can take over
  the role previously played by instances and symbols, without the need
  for special treatment all over the place.

  - Support for weighted root nodes. 

  - Some enhancements to the POS/default lexical entry machinery.

  - Preparations for online morphology. The preprocessor now parses the
  morphological rules, and can store them into the binary grammar file.
  Runtime support is still missing.

  - Removed all builtin types except `*top*'. This means better
  compatibility with other systems (LKB); it also means a grammar now
  has to supply definitions for things like list, cons, atom, etc. This is
  not a problem since all existing grammars do this anyway for LKB support.
  The names for these special types have to be defined in the
  cheap.settings configuration file.

  - TDL status information is now preserved in the binary grammar file.

  - Quickcheck vector indices are now strings. This breaks backwards
  compatibility with older quickcheck path definitions, but permits to remove
  all special treatment for types whose names are all numbers. The quick check
  path generation function has been adopted for the new format.

  - Some arcance CHiC support has been removed.

  - Removed fixed arity unifiers.
